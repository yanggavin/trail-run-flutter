# Requirements Document

## Introduction

TrailRun is a mobile app for trail runners to track runs, capture geo-tagged photos, and generate rich activity summaries with offline-first reliability, secure storage, and privacy by default. The app targets everyday trail runners who need reliable GPS tracking with low battery usage, and power users who require accuracy and analytics capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: GPS Tracking Core Functionality

**User Story:** As a trail runner, I want to start, pause, resume, and stop my runs with reliable GPS tracking, so that I can accurately record my running activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I tap the start button THEN the system SHALL begin GPS tracking at 1-5 second intervals with adaptive sampling
2. WHEN I pause a run THEN the system SHALL stop recording distance and time while maintaining the session
3. WHEN I resume a paused run THEN the system SHALL continue tracking from the current location
4. WHEN I stop a run THEN the system SHALL save the complete activity with all tracking data
5. WHEN the app is backgrounded during tracking THEN the system SHALL continue recording GPS points without interruption
6. WHEN GPS accuracy degrades THEN the system SHALL display quality warnings with actionable tips

### Requirement 2: Auto-Pause and Movement Detection

**User Story:** As a runner, I want the app to automatically pause when I stop moving and resume when I start again, so that my activity data accurately reflects my actual running time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I stop moving for a configurable threshold THEN the system SHALL automatically pause tracking
2. WHEN I resume movement after auto-pause THEN the system SHALL automatically resume tracking
3. WHEN auto-pause is active THEN the system SHALL NOT record phantom distance while stationary
4. IF auto-pause thresholds are configured THEN the system SHALL respect user-defined sensitivity settings

### Requirement 3: Photo Capture with Geotagging

**User Story:** As a trail runner, I want to capture photos during my run that are automatically tagged with location and time, so that I can document my trail experience without interrupting my tracking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I tap the camera button during tracking THEN the system SHALL launch the camera interface
2. WHEN I capture a photo THEN the system SHALL return to tracking screen within 400ms (P95 < 700ms)
3. WHEN a photo is taken THEN the system SHALL store GPS location and timestamp in EXIF data
4. WHEN sharing or exporting THEN the system SHALL provide option to strip EXIF data for privacy
5. WHEN a photo is captured THEN the system SHALL link it to the active tracking session

### Requirement 4: Activity Summary Generation

**User Story:** As a runner, I want to see a comprehensive summary of my completed run including stats, map, and photos, so that I can review my performance and share my experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a run is completed THEN the system SHALL display distance, duration, average pace, and elevation gain/loss
2. WHEN viewing activity summary THEN the system SHALL show an interactive map with route polyline and photo markers
3. WHEN viewing activity details THEN the system SHALL provide per-kilometer splits and elevation chart
4. WHEN editing an activity THEN the system SHALL allow modification of title, notes, privacy settings, and cover photo selection
5. WHEN sharing an activity THEN the system SHALL generate a share card with map, key stats, and photo collage

### Requirement 5: Offline-First Operation

**User Story:** As a trail runner who often runs in areas with poor cell coverage, I want full app functionality to work offline, so that I can track runs and capture photos regardless of network connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue full tracking and photo capture functionality
2. WHEN data is created offline THEN the system SHALL store all information in encrypted local database
3. WHEN network becomes available THEN the system SHALL automatically sync data with exponential backoff and retries
4. IF sync conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL resolve using server-wins policy while preserving local unsent changes
5. WHEN signing in on new device THEN the system SHALL restore all data through backup/restore functionality

### Requirement 6: Activity History and Management

**User Story:** As a runner with many recorded activities, I want to browse, search, and manage my run history efficiently, so that I can find and review past activities easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing history THEN the system SHALL display paginated activity list with rich preview cards
2. WHEN searching activities THEN the system SHALL support text search and filters by date range, distance, and other criteria
3. WHEN sorting activities THEN the system SHALL provide options to sort by date, duration, and pace
4. WHEN refreshing history THEN the system SHALL support pull-to-refresh functionality
5. WHEN deleting an activity THEN the system SHALL require confirmation before permanent removal

### Requirement 7: Battery Optimization and Permissions

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the app to use battery efficiently and handle permissions gracefully, so that I can track long runs without draining my phone battery or encountering permission issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tracking for one hour THEN the system SHALL consume no more than 4-6% of battery
2. WHEN location permission is denied THEN the system SHALL provide clear explanation and graceful degradation
3. WHEN the app crashes during tracking THEN the system SHALL recover the in-progress session on next launch
4. WHEN requesting permissions THEN the system SHALL provide clear explanations for why each permission is needed

### Requirement 8: Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want my running data to be securely stored and shared only when I explicitly choose to do so, so that my personal information and location data remain protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is stored locally THEN the system SHALL use AES-256 encryption for the database
2. WHEN communicating with servers THEN the system SHALL use TLS 1.2+ with certificate pinning
3. WHEN creating activities THEN the system SHALL set privacy-by-default with explicit user action required for sharing
4. WHEN user requests data deletion THEN the system SHALL comply with GDPR requirements
5. WHEN user requests data export THEN the system SHALL provide complete data export functionality

### Requirement 9: GPS Signal Robustness

**User Story:** As a trail runner in challenging terrain, I want accurate GPS tracking even with intermittent signal, so that my route and distance measurements are reliable despite environmental obstacles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GPS signal has outliers THEN the system SHALL filter impossible jumps and apply Kalman smoothing
2. WHEN brief signal loss occurs THEN the system SHALL interpolate gaps intelligently
3. WHEN GPS accuracy varies THEN the system SHALL display confidence score indicator to user
4. WHEN signal quality is poor THEN the system SHALL adapt sampling strategy to maintain accuracy

### Requirement 10: Export and Sharing Capabilities

**User Story:** As a runner who uses multiple fitness platforms, I want to export my data in standard formats and share summaries easily, so that I can integrate with other tools and share my achievements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting activity THEN the system SHALL generate GPX format with optional photo bundle
2. WHEN sharing activity THEN the system SHALL create image summaries using native share functionality
3. WHEN exporting photos THEN the system SHALL include JSON metadata with location and timing information
4. WHEN sharing respects privacy settings THEN the system SHALL exclude precise coordinates if privacy mode is enabled

### Requirement 11: Cross-Platform Consistency

**User Story:** As a user who may switch between iOS and Android devices, I want consistent functionality and user experience across platforms, so that I can use the app effectively regardless of my device choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the app on different platforms THEN the system SHALL provide feature parity between iOS and Android
2. WHEN comparing performance THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent performance on mid-tier devices across platforms
3. WHEN following platform conventions THEN the system SHALL adapt UX patterns to iOS and Android norms while maintaining core functionality
4. WHEN syncing between devices THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency across different platforms
