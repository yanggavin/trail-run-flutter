- **Bounds Calculation**: Automatically calculates map bounds for route fitting
- **Route Simplification**: Optimizes large routes by reducing points for better performance
- **Snapshot Generation**: Generates map images for sharing functionality

### 2. Interactive Map Widget (`lib/presentation/widgets/activity_map_widget.dart`)
- **Full-featured Map Display**: Shows routes, photos, start/end markers
- **Interactive Controls**: Zoom, pan, and photo marker interactions
- **Performance Optimized**: Handles large routes efficiently
- **Customizable Appearance**: Configurable colors, sizes, and display options

### 3. Compact Map Widget (`lib/presentation/widgets/compact_map_widget.dart`)
- **Preview Display**: Non-interactive map for activity summaries
- **Optimized for Small Views**: Reduced detail for better performance
- **Consistent Styling**: Matches app design patterns

### 4. Map Controls Widget (`lib/presentation/widgets/map_controls_widget.dart`)
- **Zoom Controls**: In/out zoom buttons with tooltips
- **Fit to Route**: Automatically adjusts view to show entire route
- **Snapshot Capture**: Trigger map image generation
- **Customizable**: Show/hide individual controls as needed

### 5. Full-Screen Map Screen (`lib/presentation/screens/activity_map_screen.dart`)
- **Complete Map Experience**: Full-screen route visualization
- **Photo Interaction**: Tap markers to view photo details
- **Share Functionality**: Generate and share map snapshots
- **Navigation Integration**: Proper app bar and navigation

### 6. Supporting Enums
- **LocationSource**: GPS, network, fused location sources
- **PrivacyLevel**: Private, friends, public sharing levels
- **SyncState**: Local, pending, synced, failed states

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Map Widget Integration
- Integrated flutter_map package for robust mapping functionality
- Created reusable map components for different use cases
- Implemented proper state management and lifecycle handling

### ✅ Route Polyline Rendering
- Converts track points to visual route lines
- Optimizes large routes for performance (max 1000 points)
- Customizable colors and stroke widths
- Handles empty routes gracefully

### ✅ Photo Markers with Positioning
- Places markers at exact GPS coordinates from photos
- Interactive markers with tap handling
- Visual distinction from route markers
- Filters photos without location data

### ✅ Interactive Map Controls
- Zoom in/out controls with proper bounds checking
- Fit-to-route functionality for optimal viewing
- Snapshot generation for sharing
- Responsive touch interactions

### ✅ Map Snapshot Generation
- High-quality PNG image generation
- Configurable pixel ratio for different resolutions
- Error handling for failed captures
- Integration with sharing functionality

### ✅ Performance Optimization
- Route simplification for large datasets
- Efficient marker rendering
- Proper widget disposal and memory management
- Optimized tile loading

## Technical Implementation Details

### Map Service Architecture
```dart
class MapService {
  // Core conversion utilities
  static LatLng trackPointToLatLng(TrackPoint point)
  static LatLng? photoToLatLng(Photo photo)
  
  // Route visualization
  static Polyline createRoutePolyline(List<TrackPoint> trackPoints)
  static Polyline createOptimizedPolyline(List<TrackPoint> trackPoints)
  
  // Interactive elements
  static List<Marker> createPhotoMarkers(List<Photo> photos)
  static LatLngBounds? calculateBounds(List<TrackPoint> trackPoints)
  
  // Sharing functionality
  static Future<Uint8List?> generateMapSnapshot(GlobalKey mapKey)
}
```

### Widget Hierarchy
```
ActivityMapScreen (Full-screen experience)
├── ActivityMapWidget (Interactive map)
├── MapControlsWidget (Zoom, fit, share controls)
└── Photo detail dialogs

CompactMapWidget (Preview/summary use)
├── Non-interactive map display
└── Simplified markers and routes
```

## Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests (`test/data/services/map_service_test.dart`)
- ✅ Track point to LatLng conversion
- ✅ Photo coordinate handling
- ✅ Route polyline creation
- ✅ Photo marker generation
- ✅ Bounds calculation
- ✅ Route optimization algorithms
- ✅ Edge cases (empty data, large datasets)

### Integration Tests (`test/integration/map_integration_test.dart`)
- ✅ Widget rendering without errors
- ✅ Map controls functionality
- ✅ Photo interaction handling
- ✅ Screen navigation and state management

## Requirements Fulfilled

### Requirement 4.2: Interactive Route Visualization
- ✅ Route polylines rendered from GPS track points
- ✅ Start/end markers clearly visible
- ✅ Interactive zoom and pan controls
- ✅ Optimized performance for large routes

### Requirement 10.2: Photo Integration on Maps
- ✅ Photo markers positioned at GPS coordinates
- ✅ Interactive photo markers with details
- ✅ Visual distinction from route elements
- ✅ Graceful handling of photos without location

## Usage Examples

### Basic Map Display
```dart
ActivityMapWidget(
  activity: myActivity,
  onPhotoTap: (photo) => showPhotoDetails(photo),
  routeColor: Colors.blue,
  showPhotos: true,
)
```

### Compact Preview
```dart
CompactMapWidget(
  activity: myActivity,
  height: 200,
  showPhotos: false,
)
```

### Full-Screen Experience
```dart
Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(
  builder: (context) => ActivityMapScreen(
    activity: myActivity,
    title: 'Trail Run Route',
  ),
));
```

## Performance Characteristics

- **Route Optimization**: Large routes (>1000 points) automatically simplified
- **Memory Efficient**: Proper widget disposal and resource management
- **Responsive UI**: Smooth interactions even with complex routes
- **Network Optimized**: Efficient tile loading and caching

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Offline Maps**: Cache tiles for offline viewing
2. **Route Editing**: Allow manual route corrections
3. **Elevation Profile**: Show elevation changes along route
4. **Multiple Activities**: Compare routes on same map
5. **Custom Map Styles**: Different visual themes
6. **Advanced Sharing**: Social media integration

## Conclusion

The map integration and visualization functionality has been successfully implemented with comprehensive features covering route display, photo integration, interactive controls, and sharing capabilities. The implementation follows Flutter best practices with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive testing, and performance optimization.

All requirements have been fulfilled:
- ✅ Map widget integration (flutter_map)
