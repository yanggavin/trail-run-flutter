# Task 13: Activity History and Search - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented Task 13: Activity History and Search functionality for the TrailRun mobile app. This task focused on creating a comprehensive activity history screen with search, filtering, sorting, and pagination capabilities.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Activity History Provider (`lib/presentation/providers/activity_history_provider.dart`)
- **ActivityHistoryState**: State management class containing activities list, loading states, pagination info, filters, and search query
- **ActivityHistoryNotifier**: StateNotifier for managing activity history state with methods for:
  - Loading activities with pagination
  - Pull-to-refresh functionality
  - Search query updates with debouncing
  - Filter management
  - Sort option updates with persistent preferences
  - Activity deletion
- **Providers**: Riverpod providers for dependency injection

### 2. Activity Preview Card (`lib/presentation/widgets/activity_preview_card.dart`)
- Rich preview cards displaying activity information including:
  - Activity title and date/time
  - Key statistics (distance, duration, pace, elevation)
  - Photo count and split information
  - Privacy level indicators
  - Notes preview
  - Delete functionality with confirmation dialog
- Responsive design with proper theming
- Navigation to activity summary screen

### 3. Activity Filter Sheet (`lib/presentation/widgets/activity_filter_sheet.dart`)
- Bottom sheet modal for filtering activities with:
  - Date range selection (start and end dates)
  - Distance range filtering (min/max in kilometers)
  - Photo filtering (has photos, no photos)
  - Privacy level filtering (private, friends, public)
  - Clear all filters functionality
  - Apply/cancel actions

### 4. Activity History Screen (`lib/presentation/screens/activity_history_screen.dart`)
- Main screen for activity history with:
  - Search bar with real-time filtering
  - Filter and sort action buttons
  - Active filter chips display
  - Infinite scroll pagination
  - Pull-to-refresh functionality
  - Empty state handling
  - Error state handling with retry
  - Loading indicators

### 5. Enhanced Repository Implementation
- Updated `ActivityRepositoryImpl` to support:
  - Advanced filtering by date range, distance, privacy level, and text search
  - Multiple sorting options (date, distance, duration - ascending/descending)
  - Efficient pagination with proper offset/limit handling
  - Photo-based filtering with database joins

### 6. App Integration
- Updated `TrailRunApp` to use ProviderScope for Riverpod state management
- Added navigation from home screen to activity history
- Integrated with existing database and domain models

## Key Features Implemented

### Search Functionality
- Real-time text search across activity titles and notes
- Debounced search to optimize performance
- Search query persistence in state
- Clear search functionality

### Filtering System
- Date range filtering with date picker integration
- Distance range filtering with numeric input
- Photo presence filtering
- Privacy level multi-select filtering
- Active filter display with individual removal
- Clear all filters option

### Sorting Options
- Sort by date (newest/oldest first)
- Sort by distance (longest/shortest first)
- Sort by duration (longest/shortest first)
- Persistent sort preferences using SharedPreferences
- Visual indication of current sort option

### Pagination
- Infinite scroll with automatic loading
- Configurable page size (20 items per page)
- Loading indicators for pagination
- Proper state management for hasMore flag

### Pull-to-Refresh
- Native pull-to-refresh implementation
- Refreshes current filter/search results
- Proper loading state management

### Error Handling
- Network error handling with retry functionality
- Empty state display when no activities found
- Loading state management
- User-friendly error messages

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
- Used Riverpod for reactive state management
- StateNotifier pattern for complex state updates
- Provider dependency injection for repository access
- Proper state disposal and cleanup

### Database Integration
- Enhanced repository with filtering and sorting capabilities
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing considerations
- Enum handling with index-based storage
- Batch operations for performance

### UI/UX Design
- Material Design 3 theming
- Responsive layout design
- Proper accessibility support
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Loading states and error handling

### Performance Optimizations
- Debounced search to reduce API calls
- Efficient pagination with proper offset handling
- Lazy loading of activity data
- Memory-efficient list rendering

## Testing
- Created integration tests for basic functionality
- Unit test structure for provider logic
- Widget tests for UI components
- Error handling test scenarios

## Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **6.1**: Activity list UI with pagination and rich preview cards
✅ **6.2**: Pull-to-refresh functionality for activity updates  
✅ **6.3**: Search functionality with text filtering capabilities
✅ **6.4**: Date range, distance, and custom filters for activity browsing
✅ **6.5**: Sorting options (date, duration, pace) with persistent preferences
