- Geotagged photo filtering
- Privacy controls (EXIF stripping)

### 4. Photo Repository Implementation (`lib/data/repositories/photo_repository_impl.dart`)
- **Database Integration**: Full CRUD operations using existing PhotoDao
- **File System Management**: Coordinated file and database operations
- **Stream Support**: Real-time photo updates for UI
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling and recovery

**Key Features:**
- Transactional photo creation and deletion
- Stream-based photo watching
- Cover candidate queries
- Storage statistics and cleanup

### 5. Riverpod Providers (`lib/data/services/photo_provider.dart`)
- **Dependency Injection**: Clean separation of concerns
- **State Management**: Photo capture and management state
- **Stream Providers**: Real-time photo updates
- **Future Providers**: Async photo operations

**Key Features:**
- PhotoManager and CameraService providers
- Activity-specific photo streams
- Cover photo candidate providers
- Photo capture state management
- Photo management operations

## Database Integration

### Existing Schema Utilization
- **PhotosTable**: Leveraged existing table structure
- **PhotoDao**: Used existing DAO with all CRUD operations
- **Database Provider**: Integrated with existing database setup

### Key Database Features
- GPS coordinate storage (latitude, longitude, elevation)
- EXIF metadata flags
- Curation scoring
- Thumbnail path tracking
- Activity linking via foreign key

## Testing Implementation

### Unit Tests
- **PhotoService Tests**: Core functionality without platform dependencies
- **CameraService Tests**: Service behavior and error handling
- **PhotoManager Tests**: Business logic and coordination (with mocks)
- **PhotoRepository Tests**: Database operations and file management

### Integration Tests
- **Photo Capture Integration**: End-to-end capture flow testing
- **Database Integration**: Repository and DAO interaction testing
- **Performance Tests**: Capture timing and operation efficiency
- **Error Handling Tests**: Graceful failure scenarios

## Performance Optimizations

### Capture Speed (< 400ms Target)
- **Timeout Protection**: 400ms timeout on capture operations
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking thumbnail generation
- **Optimized Settings**: High resolution with disabled audio
- **Minimal Processing**: Essential operations only in capture path

### Memory Management
- **Efficient Image Processing**: Stream-based image handling
- **Thumbnail Caching**: Separate thumbnail storage
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper disposal of camera resources

### Storage Optimization
- **Activity-based Organization**: Hierarchical folder structure
- **Orphaned File Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of unused files
- **Compression**: JPEG compression with quality settings
