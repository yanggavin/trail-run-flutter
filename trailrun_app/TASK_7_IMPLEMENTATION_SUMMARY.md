# Task 7: Activity Tracking Core Logic - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the complete activity tracking core logic for the TrailRun mobile app, including ActivityRepository with Drift database integration, activity lifecycle management, real-time statistics calculation, auto-pause functionality, and crash recovery.

## Components Implemented

### 1. ActivityRepositoryImpl (`lib/data/repositories/activity_repository_impl.dart`)
- **Complete CRUD operations** for activities with Drift database integration
- **Track point management** with batch operations for performance
- **Real-time statistics calculation** using Haversine formula for distance
- **Elevation gain/loss calculation** from GPS altitude data
- **Search and filtering** capabilities with pagination
- **Sync state management** for offline-first operation
- **Activity statistics aggregation** for reporting

**Key Features:**
- Automatic statistics updates when track points are added
- Efficient batch operations for multiple track points
- Complete activity lifecycle with related data (track points, photos, splits)
- Search functionality across activity titles and notes
- Date range filtering and sorting options

### 2. ActivityTrackingService (`lib/data/services/activity_tracking_service.dart`)
- **Complete activity lifecycle management** (start, pause, resume, stop)
- **Real-time statistics calculation** (distance, pace, elevation, speed)
- **Auto-pause functionality** with configurable thresholds
- **Crash recovery** with session restoration
- **State persistence** and error handling
- **Reactive streams** for UI updates

**Key Features:**
- Auto-pause when speed drops below threshold (default 0.5 m/s for 10 seconds)
- Auto-resume when speed increases above threshold (default 1.0 m/s)
- Real-time statistics with moving averages and smoothing
- Comprehensive state management with stream-based updates
- Battery-efficient location processing with adaptive sampling

### 3. ActivityTrackingProvider (`lib/data/services/activity_tracking_provider.dart`)
- **Dependency injection** for service management
- **Singleton pattern** for consistent state
- **Configuration management** for auto-pause settings
- **Factory methods** for repository and location service instances

### 4. Enhanced Measurement Units (`lib/domain/value_objects/measurement_units.dart`)
- **Added Speed class** for velocity measurements
- **Comprehensive unit conversions** (m/s, km/h, mph)
- **Type-safe value objects** for all measurements

## Testing Implementation

### 1. ActivityRepositoryImpl Tests (`test/data/repositories/activity_repository_impl_test.dart`)
- **17 comprehensive test cases** covering all functionality
- **CRUD operations testing** with database integration
- **Statistics calculation verification** with real data
- **Search and filtering validation**
- **Sync state management testing**
- **Edge cases and error conditions**

### 2. ActivityTrackingService Tests (`test/data/services/activity_tracking_basic_test.dart`)
- **7 integration test cases** for core functionality
- **Activity lifecycle testing** (start, pause, resume, stop)
- **State management verification** with stream testing
- **Error handling validation**
- **Basic statistics calculation testing**
