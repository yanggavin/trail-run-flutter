## Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 7.2: Battery Optimization and Permissions
- ✅ Graceful permission handling with clear explanations
- ✅ Platform-specific permission request flows
- ✅ Battery-optimized background tracking

### Requirement 11.1: Cross-Platform Consistency
- ✅ Feature parity between iOS and Android
- ✅ Platform-appropriate UX patterns
- ✅ Consistent core functionality

## Technical Implementation Details

### Method Channels
- `com.trailrun.location_service`: Location and tracking operations
- `com.trailrun.permissions`: Permission management
- `com.trailrun.app_lifecycle`: App state changes

### Platform-Specific Configurations
- iOS: Background modes, Info.plist permissions, Swift integration
- Android: Foreground service, manifest permissions, Kotlin integration

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when platform features unavailable
- Fallback mechanisms for permission denials
- Comprehensive error logging and user feedback

### Performance Considerations
- Minimal battery impact during background operation
- Efficient file operations with proper cleanup
- Optimized accessibility checks and adaptations

## Usage Examples

### Permission Request Flow
```dart
PermissionRequestFlow(
  onPermissionsGranted: () {
    // Start tracking with full permissions
  },
  onPermissionsDenied: () {
    // Handle limited functionality
  },
)
```

### Accessible Widgets
```dart
AccessibleButton(
  onPressed: () => startTracking(),
  semanticLabel: 'Start tracking your run',
  child: Text('Start'),
)
```

### Platform-Specific Operations
```dart
await PlatformSpecificService.startForegroundService(activityId);
await PlatformFileService.shareFile(filePath: gpxPath, fileName: 'run.gpx');
```

## Future Enhancements
1. Enhanced accessibility features (voice control, gesture navigation)
2. Advanced battery optimization strategies
3. Platform-specific UI animations and transitions
4. Extended file format support
5. Advanced permission education flows

This implementation provides a solid foundation for platform-specific features while maintaining code reusability and consistent user experience across iOS and Android platforms.
