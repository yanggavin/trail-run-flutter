### 3. Real-time Stats Display (`tracking_stats_widget.dart`)
- **Primary stats** (large display):
  - Distance in kilometers with adaptive precision
  - Elapsed time in HH:MM:SS or MM:SS format
  - Current pace in MM:SS/km format
- **Secondary stats** (smaller display):
  - Average pace
  - Elevation gain
  - Track point count
  - Photo count
- **Status indicator** showing current tracking state
- **Tabular figures** for consistent number alignment
- **Color-coded stats** for better visual hierarchy

### 4. GPS Quality Indicator (`gps_quality_indicator.dart`)
- **Real-time GPS quality display** with color-coded status:
  - Green: Excellent signal (8+ satellites, <5m accuracy)
  - Orange: Good signal (4-7 satellites, 5-20m accuracy)
  - Red: Poor signal (<4 satellites, >20m accuracy)
- **Detailed information popup** showing:
  - GPS enabled/disabled status
  - Accuracy in meters
  - Satellite count
  - Signal strength percentage
  - Overall quality score
- **Actionable tips** for improving GPS signal quality
- **Compact and detailed view modes**

### 5. Battery Usage Indicator (`battery_usage_indicator.dart`)
- **Real-time battery monitoring** with simulated data (ready for battery_plus integration)
- **Usage rate calculation** in percentage per hour
- **Estimated time remaining** based on current usage
- **Charging status detection**
- **Battery optimization indicators**:
  - Green: Optimized usage (<6%/hour)
  - Orange: High usage (>6%/hour)
  - Red: Critical battery level (<15%)
- **Detailed battery information dialog** with usage tips

### 6. Auto-pause Indicator (`auto_pause_indicator.dart`)
- **Animated indicator** when auto-pause is active
- **Pulsing animation** to draw attention
- **Manual override controls**:
  - Resume button to continue tracking
  - Settings button to adjust auto-pause parameters
- **Auto-pause settings dialog** with:
  - Sensitivity adjustment
  - Delay configuration
  - Speed threshold settings
- **Educational tips** about auto-pause functionality

### 7. Camera Quick Capture (`camera_quick_capture_widget.dart`)
- **Live camera preview** (120px height for quick reference)
- **One-tap photo capture** with <400ms return to tracking
- **Visual feedback**:
  - Flash effect on capture
  - Loading indicator during capture
  - Error messages with retry options
- **Geotagging integration** with current location
- **Disabled state** when not tracking
- **Error handling** for camera permissions and failures

## Technical Features

### State Management
- **Riverpod providers** for reactive state management
- **Real-time updates** from location and tracking services
- **Error state handling** with user-friendly messages
- **Loading states** with progress indicators

### User Experience
- **Haptic feedback** for all interactions
- **Visual feedback** with animations and color changes
- **Accessibility support** with proper contrast and sizing
- **Responsive design** that works on different screen sizes
- **Dark theme optimized** for outdoor use

### Performance Optimizations
- **Efficient rendering** with minimal rebuilds
- **Memory management** with proper disposal
- **Battery optimization** with adaptive GPS sampling
- **Background processing** support

### Error Handling
- **Graceful degradation** when services are unavailable
- **User-friendly error messages** with actionable solutions
- **Retry mechanisms** for failed operations
- **Fallback states** for missing data

## Integration Points

### Navigation
- **App router integration** with tracking route
- **Deep linking support** for direct navigation
- **Proper back navigation** with confirmation dialogs

### Services
- **Camera service integration** for photo capture
- **Location service integration** for GPS tracking
- **Activity tracking service** for statistics
- **Battery monitoring** (ready for platform integration)

### Providers
- **Activity tracking provider** for real-time stats
- **Location provider** for GPS quality and position
- **Photo provider** for camera integration
- **Battery usage provider** for power monitoring

## Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **1.1**: GPS tracking with start/pause/resume/stop controls
✅ **1.2**: Real-time stats display (distance, pace, time)
✅ **1.6**: GPS quality indicator with actionable feedback
✅ **2.1**: Auto-pause indicator and manual override controls
✅ **3.1**: Camera integration with quick access during tracking
