# TrailRun Mobile App

A mobile app for trail runners to track runs, capture geo-tagged photos, and generate rich activity summaries with offline-first reliability, secure storage, and privacy by default.

## Features

- **GPS Tracking**: Start/stop, pause/resume, background tracking, auto-pause, accuracy control
- **Photo Capture**: Geo-tagged photos during activities with fast return to tracking (< 400ms)
- **Activity Summary**: Stats, interactive maps, photo markers, splits, elevation charts
- **Offline-First**: Full functionality offline with automatic cloud sync and conflict resolution
- **History Management**: Activity list with search, filters, and sorting
- **Privacy & Security**: Encrypted local storage, privacy-by-default sharing, data export/deletion
- **Cross-Platform**: Consistent experience on iOS and Android with platform-specific optimizations
- **Performance Optimized**: Battery usage < 6% per hour, responsive UI with large datasets
- **Error Recovery**: Crash recovery, graceful degradation, comprehensive error handling

## Architecture

The app follows a clean architecture pattern with three main layers:

- **Presentation Layer**: Flutter UI with Riverpod state management
- **Domain Layer**: Business logic, entities, and repository interfaces
- **Data Layer**: Local database (Drift) and remote API integration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (>=3.10.0)
- Dart SDK (>=3.0.0)
- iOS development: Xcode and iOS Simulator
- Android development: Android Studio and Android SDK

### Installation
